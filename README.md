## Theme: Social Impact
 
We aim to build a simple and interactive platform for women who are curious to gain
knowledge but do not have enough sources and guidance. We will be using socket.io
library in NodeJS.

Some women mostly find it troublesome to learn things on their own through YouTube
videos and search engines and many a times their doubts remain unsolved.

  * **_A live classroom environment_**
  
     As we know that classroom teaching is one of the most efficient and easy teaching
     techniques. Women of similar interests with the help of a teacher(volunteer) can
     learn their respective topics by creating their own classroom.
     Teacher will explain the topic verbally while writing simultaneously.
     Till that the audio control will only be there for teacher and students will be in
     listening mode.
  
  * **_Doubt Clarification_**
  
     Every student will have a doubt button. On clicking that button during the live lecture,
     an event will be emitted and every member of that class will be notified. On teacher’s
     permission audio control will go to that particular student and whole class will listen
     to her query. If teacher doesn’t permit, then a text box will appear and student can write
     her doubt so that it can be queued and asked after session.
  
  * **_FAQ Room_**
  
     The problems faced by students during self-studying can be written to a FAQ board
     where fellow students or teacher can clarify that doubt.

  * **_Resource room_**
  
     Sources can be shared by teachers such as links to useful videos, eBooks and so on.
